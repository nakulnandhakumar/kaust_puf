# VCSEL PUF Classifier

This repository contains code and tools to classify and match one-dimensional (1D) sequences of intensity variations generated by chaotic D-shaped Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs). These sequences are unique to each VCSEL and serve as Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) for device authentication. The main functionalities include a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification, data handling, and adversarial training using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

## Structure

### **1. PUF Classifier (`puf_classifier.py`)**
- Implements a 1D CNN architecture to:
  - Classify sequences of intensity variations.
  - Match intensity variation sequences to the D-shaped VCSEL that generated them.
- Includes functionality to load data sequences of intensity variations from external CSV files.

### **2. Adversarial Training (`vae.py`)**
- Contains Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) that:
  - Generate synthetic intensity variation sequences similar to those in the CSV files.
  - Enhance CNN training by introducing adversarial examples to improve robustness.

### **3. Supercomputer Job Scripts (`jobscripts/`)**
- A collection of scripts optimized for running the repository's code on the KAUST IBEX supercomputer.
- Allows for efficient batch execution of training, evaluation, and other tasks.

### **4. Neural Network Architecture Sweeps (`sweep/`)**
- Stores results of experiments that analyze the impact of varying the size of data sequences on classification accuracy.
- Provides insights into the CNN's performance across different sequence lengths.

### **5. Figures (`sweep/`)**
- Contains figures generated from the sweeps and other files ending with '_visualizer
