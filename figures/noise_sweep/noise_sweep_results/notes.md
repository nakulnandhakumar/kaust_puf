# Important Notes
- Sequence size is 10,000 points
- Device 7 is labeled as the real devie and Device 10 is labeled as the fake one

# Val Results
- Noise only added to extra validation training sets to test models resistance to noise affecting unseen data
- broad sweeps from 0% to 100% noise, narrow sweeps from 30% to 80%

# Train Val Results
- Noise applied to both training and validation datasets to test models ability to adapt to noise
